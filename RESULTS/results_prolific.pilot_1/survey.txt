wlout|14|To see how long would we take to understand that the letter down the card was the important thing.|Sort it to the one with the same letter.|yes aha|2|
moonsq|5|I have no idea honestly|Yes Put the cards by starting from left to right so we begin with the first one which makes it correct then we put it on the second one then the third and then the fourth...|yes aha|1|
wlin|13|I think that its objective was to see how people would sort cards in the long-term without looking at their colors.|The rule was to simply put the cards letters together. So C-Card to C-Card etc...|yes aha|1|
wlin|7|To find out how quickly participants could identify the rule|Yes. The letter at the top of the card matched the letter of the location that the card should go to.|yes aha|2|i was annoyed with myself that initially I had been focused on the colour, number and type of shapes without looking at the letter above each card.
moonsq|11|Following instructions and reading carefully|Sorting the cards from left to right. If you placed the last card on the most right slot, start left again.|yes aha|3|
wlin|19|To detect what people pay attention to|The rule is to sort by letters, not color or shape|yes aha|0 - extremly easy|No
wnola|22|i have no idea|at the beginning i wasn't understant what i need to do but later i rbut then I realized it was to be done in order: card in position 1, 2, 3 and 4|yes aha|7|
moonsq|23|To see how quickly we would manage to figure out how to sort the cards.|Yes. It should just be the next card every time and then repeat from the start.|yes aha|5|
wnolfs|18|To match the cards in a certain way|Yes, they have to be different colors and shapes and fit into eachother|yes aha|6|
wnol|27|the goal might have been to measure the average number of tries before identifying the proper sorting method|the rule was to sort the cards by the non-common feature|yes aha|1|very fun experiment, i'd be curious to know the real goal was! cheers :)
wnola|40|how people deal with task|yes, i followed the sequence from left to right|yes aha|6|At first i didn't get the rules but after a while, i hit the jackpot and got it
moonsq|41|Finding people's behaviour in sorting cars without too much directives given|After I was able to get the first one correct then I was putting them in an order from left to right.|yes aha|7|Finding the first correct card was a bit hard but then the rest was easy
