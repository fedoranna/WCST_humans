wlin|1|To sort cards according to their category.|Yes, the rule was to place the card into the group according to whether it was labelled A, B, C, or D.|yes aha|1|
wlout|2|I think the goal was to see if colour made a difference to the choice I made.|No, the only rule was the letter telling us where to put the card.|yes aha|2|
moonsq|5|To figure out you had to put the cards on the piles in a 1, 2, 3, 4 pattern|1, 2, 3, 4, that was the rule. I thought at first it was to do with moons and stars or 4 then 5.|yes aha|5|Fun little game
wlout|9|To see the amount ofc ards the player would go through before they arrived at the correct sorting method.|Match the letters.|yes aha|2|
wonly|7|Unsure as there were no colours or shapes just black letters.|I matched the letters - A to A etc.|yes aha|2|
wonly|14|Decision making and how we automatically class things in groups|The letter on the cards should match|no aha|1|
wnol|3|To see how long it takes different people to work out the pattern of the card game and what you have to do in order to achieve correct answers.|I found that the card I was sorting had to be dragged onto a keycard that was in every way different. It could not have the same number of shapes. It could not have the same type of shape. It could not be the same colour.|yes aha|3|No
wnol|17|to see how long it takes for someone to realise the rules following multiple incorrect answers|The card that does not match the existing card on colour, shape or number.|yes aha|50|
wlin|8|To see how quickly people can differentiate between colour number and letter|the rule was the same letter on the singular card was to be matched with the card above|yes aha|2|
wonly|21|Does an individuals ability to match two objects change over time? e.g. concentration decrease|No|no aha|2|
wnolfs|6|See if I could figure out the pattern or training an AI|Yes, it was the one that did not match the colour, shape or number.|yes aha|6|I hope I'm not training an AI
moonsq|12|I honestly cant think of a goal I achieved while doing that.|The rule was to start on the left and move right covering each key card.|yes aha|6|
wlin|29|do not know|letters|no aha|2|
wlout|16|to see what people sorted by - how colour and shape and pattern would influence|yes it was the letter under the car to the corresponding deck but it took me ages to realise as i was concentrating on colour number shape adding them together|yes aha|5|i was concerned that there was no end
wlout|30|I'm not sure|Go by the letters underneath the cards and match them.|yes aha|3|
wonly|35|I have no idea|put the cards to the same letter|yes aha|4|no
wnol|24|to figure out how to sort the cards|sort it together with a card that has nothing in common with it.|yes aha|5|
wlout|23|I think it was to see if you would naturally follow the shapes and colors on the card to classify them or if you would take note of the letter below the deck which tells you where to place them.|The letter below the deck indicated where the card should be placed.|yes aha|2|It was good because it made sure that I double checked to see that I wasn't rushing through it and missed a letter below the deck. One tends to get complacent once you know the formula.
moonsq|19|Frustration of the participant.|Possibly - order of 2nd card, third card, fourth card, first card.|yes aha|10|I thought my computer was not working correctly - still not convinced that it was alright.
wonly|49|not sure|no|no aha|1|
moonsq|47|To work out the rule to the card game without being given any instruction.|Yes, To start from 1 to 4 and place them accordingly on each card.|yes aha|7|
wonly|42|To test how quickly a person can complete the task.|No particular rule just aimed to complete it as quickly as I could.|yes aha|1|I enjoyed this experiment - Thank you
||To  determine how quickly I found the correct rule, as different information on the card indicated it should be sorted into different areas|Sort by letter
|||Found it after the first card|yes aha|1|Fun
moonsq|26|To sort the cards and find a pattern|Yes. Put a card on each pile starting from the left.|yes aha|8|
||Testing how we experimented with different options for sorting before coming to a conclusion|It was sorting based on the letter on the cards and nothing else.|yes aha|3|I somehow ignored the letter on the deck cards, and thought they were only there to label the key cards. I tried color, shape and number sorting, then ended up thinking it was something more complex before finally realising I had neglected the letters.
||To see how long it took to recognise a pattern|Yes but it took a while. The rule was to place it on the card that was completely unrelated to the colour, number or shape on the other card|yes aha|7|
moonsq|40|Seeing if random patterns affecting the choice of card|Not throughout, but then at the end they went from left to right|yes aha|2|
wlout|44|To see how long it takes for the person to think outside the box or to be more aware of their surroundings|the card went to the whatever place was dictated by the letter under the deck at the time.|yes aha|4|
wlin|15|To see how people process pattern recognition in puzzles.|It cant be the same color, shape, or number of shapes on the cards you put on the previous one.|yes aha|4|Thanks for the opportunity.
||To test whether the number of shapes on the card or color impacted where you put the card|I sorted by letter.|yes aha|1|
wnolfs|27|To have someone learn the algorithm of the decks sorting system.|The rule for sorting was to pair each card to another card that had no similarities to it. Ie: Shape, Color, Quantity.|yes aha|6|Felt fulfilling to figure out the algorithm. :)
||To investigate how people determine and apply rules|Yes, the rule was to sort the cards by letter, rather than shape or colour|yes aha|3|
||To determine how quickly people determine the sorting rule.|Yes, but it took me an embarrassing amount of time. I first tried by colour, then type of symbol, then number of symbols. None worked and I was very confused, then realized that each card had a letter: That was the rule! But the automatic impulse was still hard to overwrite, and I still sorted a few based on colour or number.|yes aha|7|n/a
||figure out the rule for sorting objects with different variables.|fit the cards according to the letters.|yes aha|1|no.
||figure out the rule for sorting objects with different variables.|fit the cards according to the letters.|yes aha|1|no.
||Matching letters or coloured shapes.|If the shapes don't match, match the letters instead.|yes aha|1|
wlin|43|Organizational skills|Yes, the derk cards had the matched letter for the key cards.|yes aha|5|None
wlin|36|Something about how people work out a rule when they have to guess and are given feedback|The card went on the pile in which none of the characteristics matched the card drawn from the deck e.g. a one red square card could not go on the pile with a one symbol card, nor the pile wiht red symbols, nor the pile with square symbols. So you had to look at each pile in turn to do the task rather than it being simple matching of colour, shape or number|yes aha|3|
||To test your reasoning powers.|The cards should have just been sorted by matching them with the corresponding letter. The colour and pattern on the cards were irrelevant.|yes aha|6|It took me too long to see the obvious and easiest solution. I assumed the cards should be sorted into corresponding colours or patterns.
||sort out objects according to one common variable|sort cards according to letters|yes aha|1|no.
wnolfs|13|I Personally think the goal of the experiment was to see wether or not the code of the game works ( to see if cards can be placed into a box) because i couldnt find a pattern to it, random cards could be placed|No|no aha|6|Please make the game much more exciting and give out an example of how the game should be played at the beginning of the game.
wnol|38|Not sure.|Each 'key' card should fit with one of the top cards by following the rule that the picture on the top did not share any of the qualities with the key card, e.g. a single blue star would go on the three yellow squares.|yes aha|5|Quite fun when I realised it had a solution!
wnolfs|48|chose the opposite card|chose the opposite card color shape and number|yes aha|6|
||see how good participants are at solving logic problems|the card given matched the only card that it had nothing in common with|yes aha|4|
||To know if one can find the rule of the sorting.|the letter in the deck  card must correspond to the letter in the key cards, not minding the colour or the shape.|yes aha|5|none
wnolfs|34|Unsure|Yes - start with first card and work way across regardless of colour/shape/number|yes aha|3|

wonly|56|Not sure, how quickly you can figure out how to arrange the cards|Just followed the letter on the cards|no aha|1|
wlin|50|I'm not certain, but perhaps to do with pattern recognition?|Of course, it's the letter at the bottom of the cards. Took me a minut ethough.|yes aha|3|thank you for allowing me to participate in this study.
wlout|51|I think it was to see whether people would find the rule to the game|You basically had to pick the card from the deck and u had to replace it with the key that does not share it's colour, shape and number.|yes aha|6|
wnol|52|To find out the correct way to sort the cards|I think I did, I tried different variations such as according to colour, symbol, value but in the end I discovered that the card belonged in the pile that it shared no common characteristic with i.e had to be of different symbol, colour and value/number of symbols|yes aha|7|None.
wlin|92|To find the rule to sort the cards|Sort cards based on the letter|yes aha|1|
wlin|85|To see how long it would take to discover the correct rule.|Match the letters on both sets.|yes aha|3|Could have been longer, fun game!
wlout|72|to see how quickly you could find the pattern|card goes to pile that shares no common qualities|yes aha|2|
wonly|70|I'm not sure - I think I got an easy version of the test; I assume some other participants got a more difficult version in which the correct way to sort cards was more ambiguous.|I simply dropped each card onto the matching one at the top.|no aha|1|
wlin|99|To see if people were swayed with the colours and the shapes.|Matching the correct letters A B C D in the right pile|yes aha|4|
wlout|79|To see how quickly people can sort cards?|Says at the bottom of the screen which pile to put it on.|yes aha|1|N/A
wonly|63|no clue|same letter|no aha|1|if you were testing for the &quot;aha&quot; moment, it would have been better to have multiple levels of the previous game with variance, since one test would be obvious from the get-go nullifying the possibility for figuring out the rule.
wlout|100|cognitive test|yes I did. I figured the clue was in the letters underneath the cards|yes aha|1|I liked the experiment
wlin|71|To see if we could work out how the cards were matched|Yes I did, the letter on the card was to match the letter of the row of cards|no aha|1|
wonly|77|I'm not sure|I simply placed each card over the corresponding letter above|yes aha|1|Not sure it worked - all I saw was 4 cards A, B, C, D &amp; each card from the deck had a corresponding letter. Made it very easy.
wonly|105|To check cards could be matched correctly|The letters corresponded|yes aha|1|
moonsq|75|See how long I would do the experiment as I kept getting incorrect|No rule until the end|no aha|10|
wnolfs|69|to match the card from the deck with the key card that had NO correlation.|to sort the deck, place the card from the deck onto the key card that has no similarities. I.e. different colour, different shape AND different number of symbols.|yes aha|1|It was easy when applying a strategy from the very start
wonly|84|To sort by letters|Same letters|yes aha|1|
moonsq|103|Unsure, found it quite confusing|Follow the pack left to right|yes aha|6|
moonsq|68|To assess how you picked the cards|I thought there was but it changed|yes aha|5|
wnolfs|62|unsure|yes, left to right|yes aha|7|no
wlout|107|To test perception of peoples eyes to colour and shapes|Look at the letters|yes aha|3|n/a
moonsq|89|To see how long it takes people to work out correct sequence of card dealing|Yes. Deal from the deck to the first key card, then the 2nd, then the 3rd and then the fourth and repeat till call the deck of cards are used up.|yes aha|3|
wnol|94|To see whether I would persist despite getting it wrong multiple times.|To find a card that did not correspond with the colour, shape, or number.|yes aha|7|N/A
wlin|106|If I can differentiate between the colors, the shapes and the letters and ensure the correct card is placed in the correct area|I matched the correct letters and ignored the colors and the shapes|yes aha|5|At first I thought I had to drag the card from the top to the deck and then realized it was the other way round.
moonsq|82|I really honestly don't know, may be the level of perserveance of the participant!|I think so, though it would be nice to have it clarified.  Eventually it seemed that if I dealt the cards from left to right it seemed to work.|yes aha|4|I feel I must be not an overly confident person as I would just like to know for sure that I managed to find the correct way.  I think it took me a little while also as with other studies they often give you examples and I was assuming that this would be the case however you were straight in wondering what was going wrong!
wonly|91|To put the cards in the correct pile|Matching the letters together|yes aha|1|
wnol|59|To get as many correct as possible|Yes, the rule was to find the card that had no relevance both in terms of shape, colour and number of items in each card.|yes aha|7|Enjoyed this thanks. Hope all goes well with your study.
wlin|64|figuring out the correct way|ABC|yes aha|5|
wnolfs|104|Im not sure... to see how many tries on average it takes for participants to figure out the correct way to sort?|it seemed that each card belonged on top of another card with nothing in common between them (number, color or shape)|yes aha|3|nice change of pace,thanks, and best wishes
wlin|113|ability to focus on alphabet|no|no aha|3|no
moonsq|110|I think the goal  was to see if it's possible to figure out the rules of the game.|The card from a deck had to be sorted firstly to the card on the left and have the colors match some of the pattern from the deck card. Then the same had to be done for the card next to the left one and so on.|yes aha|4|No
moonsq|117|I've absolutely no idea!|No!|no aha|8|
wlout|86|Observation skills.|Yes, it was the letter below the deck.|yes aha|7|D'oh.
wnol|80|I really dont know.  I thought I figured out a pattern but then it didnt work.|I thought I did but then not.|yes aha|10|
wnolfs|83|To make me mad!!!!|Towards the end I found that just sequencing the cards - adding it to the next one along was correct - up until that I was trying all sorts of combinations|yes aha|9|HORRIBLE!!!!! I was really frustrated and found it VERY irritating...Thanks for that!
wnol|115|n/a|the cards should be sorted into the group that has no similar characteristics (different shape, colour, configuration).|yes aha|2|n/a
wnol|73|To find the correct sequence of numbers colours and shapes|No I didnt|yes aha|10|
wnol|101|working out the pattern|not really|yes aha|7|
wnolfs|97|To see if I could work out the sequence|no|no aha|8|
moonsq|96|It one's patience, understanding and moving of cards.|No I did not. It seemed very randomly.|no aha|6|
wnol|66|to memorise which colour, shape and number went in which sequence|one red triangle, two  green stars, three yellow squares, four blue circles|yes aha|7|took me a while to work out what was going on
wlout|114|How long it takes someone to figure out the pattern|It cannot be the same colour, shape, or number as the deck it is sorting into.|yes aha|6|The survey initially didn't work, as it froze when I got to the game phase, although after loading up the experiment again it worked. I hope this doesn't affect my data.
wnol|87|To see if candidates can discern sequences|No I didn't|no aha|10|I still don't know the solution, but I think I would have had to record the correct answers to identify it.....which I didn't do
wonly|119|To sort the cards into the correct decks|I redid the experiment, in this second attempt instead of coloured shapes I got letters A, B, C, D. The experiment was fairly straight forward to sort the bottom letter card into the correct deck at the top, in this case matching the letters.|yes aha|1|I'm a little confused as I had an issue with the experiment. This is my second attempt. In my first attempt the cards were different coloured shapes, and a number of shapes on each card at the top from 1 triangle, to 2 squares and so on. In this attempt the the page would not reload I had to do this myself and there was no sign of completion. The second attempt became extremely easy in comparison being just letters A,B,C&amp;D which we had to match the bottom card with.
wnol|108|to think about what category you would put the card in. I tried to group them in colour, number and shapes.|No I didn't find the correct rule.|no aha|10|10 as I didnt find the correct way of sorting the cards. I would like to know what the correct way of sorting the cards was as I am still unsure.
wnolfs|76|To find out how people figure out patterns|Honestly, after a while I thought I did, and it helped sorting some in a row, but it failed me, so in the end, I just dragged to what felt right and it ended up being right multiple times in a row.|yes aha|4|
wlin|120|Originally, I thought it was to figure out a pattern. But now I think it was more about the aha moment, as described below. Perhaps how long it takes to realise there could be a different way to try things and reach that aha moment? I'm not entirely sure!|To ignore the colours and shapes and just pay attention to the letters!|yes aha|2|It's challenging to rate its difficulty! Once I cottoned on, it was incredibly easy (a 1!), but perhaps I should've cottoned on sooner.
wlout|121|TO determine how long it took the participant to figure out the pattern, to consider presumed external elements to the puzzle|It follows the letter below the card|yes aha|5|
wnolfs|111|To try and determine a pattern .|A pattern seamed to be forming but as soon as you think you have a pattern it fails then you go what is the pattern .|yes aha|7|I would like to no what the rule for selecting the right pattern was to see how far i was from cracking it .  It appeared to be a number sequence rather than a color or shape .

wonly|126|To Determine How People Learn From Feedback|Sort the Cards According to Their Letter - The Cards Had Letters in My Experiment|yes aha|1|Technical Issues, When I Loaded The Experiment, and sorted the first card, and its just sitting there saying 'Correct'I had to reload it for ot to move into the next card
wnola|133|To see how long it took me to catch on the card game's pattern|Yes, you had to place the cards one by one from left to right across the piles and then start back on the far left again and keep going.|yes aha|4|
wnolfs|146|To determine how quickly people can work out a rule from limited guidance|The card from the deck had to be paired with the only 'key card' which did not share a single property (number/shape/colour)|yes aha|6|
wnola|140|How long people take to work it out.|just sorted into the piles in order 1, 2, 3, 4.|yes aha|6|
wnola|136|To work out what you wanted to do with the cards|yes, 1,2,3,4 and repeat|yes aha|3|none
wnola|143|Pattern learning?|I got most wrong until i realised you have to Sort them in sequence and it had nothing to do with colour or shape.|yes aha|6|
wnola|139|To see if we could find a rule.|Yes, the cards were just put in order left to right. the symbols were irrelevant.|yes aha|5|I got bored with being wrong all the time and just mechanically tried to finish the test without looking for a solution then I noticed the pattern. When I stopped looking, I saw.
wnola|134|To figure out how the cards matched up.|Maybe, at the end one card just went onto each pile repeatedly|no aha|8|
wnola|144|To judge the candidate's ability in figuring out sequences.|Yes. Left to right.|yes aha|5|I feel stupid now! I feel that I should have figured it out sooner.
wlout|149|to match the cards up that do not match|match the cards to a card that does not have same colour, shape or number as the other card.|yes aha|5|it was interesting, i didn't notice the letters until later in the study beneath the stack of cards at the bottom as i had not pulled the screen up far enough to see them so possibly might have noticed the sorting rule quicker.
wlin|148|To see whether the number of shapes or the colours on the cards would make me choose the wrong pairings to match.|The rule was to match the cards letters, i.e. cards with 'A' on them should be dragged on to other card with 'A' on it, and so on.|yes aha|4|
wnola|141|im not sure, i would say to try to identify a pattern to solve a problem.|yes, i found it way late on the game, but it was just a sequence that didnt care about color of shape, just had to put one on each stack clockwise.|yes aha|7|it was fun!
moonsq|145|no idea|I did not sorry|yes aha|9|
wnola|135|I have no idea|not really. It felt pretty random.|no aha|5|
wnola|132|To see if I could pick up on a pattern.|I did not!  It was frustrating.|no aha|9|no
wnola|151|pattern recongition|i did not|no aha|9|the survey was much longer than stated on prolific. almost double the time.
moonsq|152|the goal was to sort the moons card in the different cards and see if the individual formed an pattern depending on correct or incorrect selections, if the individual formed an sequence.|an rule to try each card and see if it matched, process of elimination.|no aha|4|
wnola|131|To determine is I could figure out a pattern to determine which values were correct|No, I thought it might be the colour match or the number of items. But when I experimented with these I did not get a consistent result.|no aha|10|
||I think it was to do with spatial awareness, whether you could put the right card in the right deck based on the shapes that were on the cards, whether more attention was paid to the shape or the colour|No!!!|no aha|8|
wlin|190|To see how different mindsets would begin to organize things.|By the number on the bottom of the card.|yes aha|2|It was fun!
wnola|186|To see how fast we could recognise a pattern?|Yes, sort in chronological order|yes aha|4|
wonly|189|To determine a subject's ability to identify patterns.|The rule was matching the value of the card from the deck to one of the key cards (i.e. A=A, B=B, etc.)|yes aha|1|The experiment ended fairly abruptly; it didn't even seem like I was finished going through all of the cards yet. Instead of an alert via the browser to signal the completion of the experiment, a graphic or writing on the page would have been preferable.
moonsq|187|Whether people find a correlation in an experiment when there might not be a correlation|By the end, sorting the cards from 1-4 in order seemed to work but it doesn't seem apparent as an actual rule, instead rather random.|no aha|10|
wnolfs|188|MOT SURE|ONCE I DISCOVERED THAT LEFT CARD WAS CORRECT, I WENT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND THEY CAME UP CORRECT.|yes aha|5|NONE
moonsq|194|It was to see how people detect patterns and follow them.|The rule was to start with the third card from the left and continue left to right, starting over at the end of the row.|yes aha|1|
wonly|203|To see if we could sort the cards by letter of the alphabet|Just match the letter with the same letter|no aha|1|no
wlin|197|have no idea and the game didn't make sense|at first, i had no idea then noticed a letter telling me where to put them|no aha|7|card game didn't make sense to me
wlout|205|To see what choices of sorting we took first (most intuitive)|The letter at the bottom represented what pile to put it in|yes aha|4|none
wlout|198|To see how different people sort the cards|the letter indicates how to sort the cards|yes aha|5|No
moonsq|201|to see if people would give up trying|1, 2, 3, 4 - according to the number of shapes on the card|yes aha|2|more than one round would be interesting
wnolfs|195|How long it took to crack the code|The card had to not have same number colour or shape,|yes aha|5|it was fun
wnola|193|To work out how it worked.|Yes, I found out midway that they just went in order from where I got the correct shapes from onto the next shape.|yes aha|6|
wonly|196|I assume I was in a control group or something so I can't say for sure, but probably to see how long it takes someone to figure out different types of rule patterns|There was simply a letter on each card and I matched it to the corresponding letter group|no aha|1|
wnolfs|202|How to think logically|Once I determined the sequence of order,It was not a problem to figure out.|yes aha|7|no
wlin|204|to see if you would be influenced by colours and patterns|letters only|no aha|1|
wnol|192|to work out the rule behind sorting the cards|yes, the card should be placed on the only card it does not match with in either number, colour or shape|yes aha|5|
wnol|199|To undrestand the problem and find the answer|Everuthink has to be diffrent the color,number and shape.|yes aha|5|it was very nice experience.
wonly|210|To see if I could correctly sort cards.||no aha|1|
wlin|211|To see if a person could ignore the colors, shapes, etc. and sort by one piece of data|Sort cards by letter|yes aha|2|
wonly|224|Unsure - it was very easy.|Yes, it was simply ABCD, very simple.|no aha|1|
wlin|218|To see how long it took participants to figure out the rule|The letter on the bottom|yes aha|7|
moonsq|215|See how long it would take us to figure out the rule to sorting the cards.|The correct sort is a repeating pattern from left to right.|yes aha|5|No further comments.  Everything worked great.  Good luck with your research!
wlout|219|how quickly you wokred out the rule|the letter was under the card|yes aha|5|Felt so stupid when I worked it out
wlin|225|It was testing to see how I perceive shapes and colors.|no|no aha|2|
wnola|200|To figure out if we could find a pattern or a rule|I did not find a rule|no aha|10|
wnolfs|216|How quickly an associative rule can be found with no given instructions|The card was to be matched to another card that did not possess any of the same attributes namely, not the same shape, colour or number of shapes on the card.|yes aha|5|
wnol|220|No idea|Correctly sorted cards were different in every respect. Different shape, differenr number of shapes and different colour.|yes aha|3|
wnola|221|To see how long it takes for people to figure out the pattern.|Yes, I had to find a correct card placement and then place each consecutive card 1 to the right in the row from the last one that was correct.|yes aha|7|
moonsq|208|I am unsure.|Yes, the card should be dragged to the first card to the left, then second one, third one then fourth one.|yes aha|4|
wlout|212|To see if people could find patterns|sometimes it was use the letter below. Other times it was the letter referred to two previous cards.|yes aha|7|
wlout|226|Something to do with logic &amp; analysis of patterns maybe.|I tried every pattern I could think of, first matching shapes, then number of items on the card, then colour, then repeating. Then noticed the letter beneath the cards &amp; thought maybe it was some odd pattern mixing all these things together but eventually seemed to be just whatever letter was below the card was what pile to place the card onto.|yes aha|6|I felt stupid at first as I kept getting it wrong no matter what variation I tried, then realised the pattern &amp; it seemed so obvious after the fact that it then became very simple.
wnol|227|see how we went about figuring out the pattern.|yes, one back of shape, unless either colour or number match, then continue back until no similarity exists.|yes aha|4|
wonly|231|Sorry I don't know|Match the letters|yes aha|2|
wnola|207|To try to find the right ruling of matching the cards.|I have no idea how they were sorted.|no aha|5|
wnol|234|Unsure|Yes. The card with the closest number of symbols which were not the same colour or shape.|yes aha|4|
moonsq|236|to discover any set rule to correctly place card|sometimes going down the line or up the line appeared to work|yes aha|7|
wnolfs|237|To try to find a rule or pattern on how to sort the cards|I'm not sure if it was just a pattern of places so slot 1, slot 2, slot 3, slot 4 and repeat but after two cycles it would change. Maybe it was to do with the colours and shapes and so you take the colour and shape matching the card and take the sum of slot numbers modulo 3. Probably not explaining it well but that's another theory|yes aha|4|Not really, thank you!
wonly|238|Don't Know.|None.|yes aha|1|None.
wnolfs|223|To try to see if people could detect a pattern. Every single time I thought a pattern was created with the cards, a new pattern was created. I was kept off balance.|I thought it was sometimes the lower or higher card depending on the pattern. For example, 4 could be 1 or 3, 1 could be 4 0r 2, 2 could be 1 or 3 and 3 could be 4 or 2.|yes aha|60|I found it to be easy but difficult at the same time. Why? I thought I found a pattern and then it would disappear.
wlout|233|not sure|Found the letter underneath|yes aha|4|no
wlin|239|To see if people would realize what was actually going on|The letters at the bottom of the cards corresponded to the letter under the shapes|yes aha|2|i think it took me a relatively long time to realize what was going on
wnola|235|To see if we are able to detect pattern|Not really. I found circle could go on triangle for the first card, but couldn't get it|yes aha|10|
wlout|247|To see how people's brains work when grouping things together|Yes - dragging the card according to the letter below regardless of the colour or shapes on the card, e.g. if the card is labelled 'C' you drag it to the 'C' card above|yes aha|3|This was fun!
wonly|245|To see if the principal of matching like with like was transferable across different matchable qualities?|A simple alphabet code, matching letter to corresponding pile.|yes aha|2|The three factors shown in the example screen (color, shape and count) would have made a more interesting test than the simple alphabet code that actually ensued.
wlout|240|To see how fast and accurately the participant sees a pattern depending on the nature of the pattern.|It is correct if none of the shape, number or colour matches.|yes aha|7|
wlin|246|To determine how long it takes for one to find the rule in sorting the cards.|Sorting the cards by letter!|yes aha|2|

wnol|241|I don't know|No|yes aha|10|
wnola|228|To see if people could figure out a pattern over time|Right at the end , i figured out that they were in sequence (1,2,3,4)|yes aha|2|
wnol|248|How long it would take it figure out the pattern to complete the task correctly.|The rule is not to match any of the object shape, the color and the number of shapes.|yes aha|7|Dragging with the mouse is tough on my carpal tunneled hands. 2 click would be easier.

wnola|249|no idea|no|no aha|4|no
wlin|253|To look at all the external information we are given - i didn't even consider the letter on the card for the first few rounds.|Matching the letter on the card - I feel dumb it took me so long to figure out.|yes aha|3|

moonsq|257|To see if you can understand how the cards should be sorted|just go 1,2,3,4 and then repeat|yes aha|5|Thank you!
wlin|267|To examine how people follow patterns.|I did find a rule for the cards, you had to match the letter on each card e.g both cards labelled 'A' go together regardless of colour or shape.|yes aha|5|
wlin|260|To see how quickly people worked out the right way to sort the cards|Yes, the letter on the card corresponded to the pile it needed to be added to.|yes aha|4|

wonly|280|I'm not sure|I'm not sure if the experiment was as designed, but the cards just had letters on them, so it was very easy to sort them in to the correct pile|no aha|1|
wnolfs|265|Honestly no idea. Perhaps testing patience.|No.|no aha|10|
wlout|261|No idea!|Not really. i thought it was not the same colour or shape. Something like add to the second pile along from the given shape seemed to work for a while but then didn't.|no aha|10|
wnol|262|Not sure|Yes. It was a certain number of cards away from the certain colour of card|yes aha|8|The website was a bit confusing as hell to use tbh.
wlin|281|goal was test your vision|the rule was to fix cards into the their appropriate key places|no aha|1|none
wnolfs|279|I believe the goal of this experiment was to see if participants could find a pattern.|Yes, match each card with its opposite color, shape, and number of shapes.|yes aha|5|No.
moonsq|271|To work out the sequence of the cards|Only part I think,  Certain cards should be placed by their house value being counted on from the value of the previous Correct card.|yes aha|9|

wnolfs|300|Cards|Make them into a deck of cards.|no aha|7|No further comments
wlin|288|to see if people group the cards through the letters on them (A B C D) which I eventually realised, or by shapes, amount of shape or colour, like what I did initially|I eventually realised it was done through letter - A B C D after firstly trying colour, same shape and amount of shapes on the card|yes aha|5|It wasn't difficult when I realised I had to do it by letter and felt really silly that I didn't try that rule sooner!
wnol|290|To see how long it took to figure the rules out?|You had to put the card in the group that had nothing in common with the card (based on shape, color, and number)|yes aha|8|none
wnolfs|286|To find out the rules by yourself|They went in order from 1-4|yes aha|7|
moonsq|299|to test my level of frustration|put the cards onto the piles starting at the left hand pile and continuing across then back to the first pile again|yes aha|3|
wonly|287|How quickly you found the rule?|The cards matched letters|yes aha|1|My mouse froze for a split second whilst I was moving a card. It went to the wrong pile so it was incorrect. It's bugging me, as not my intention. Sorry, and thank you! :)
wlout|296|To follow instructions?  I started incorrectly as I had not seen on the screen the letter below the cards until I scrolled down.|no - very confused - but did try!  Apart from the letter below card.|no aha|5|you have left me confused!
wonly|294|To see if an individual would follow instructions correctly (regardless of how monotonous).|Just place the card at the bottom on the corresponding with the same letter at the top.|no aha|1|No further comments

wnolfs|293|trying to establish a pattern for the card sorting?|no|yes aha|9|
moonsq|306|to determine how feedback affected correctness of sorting|The cards were sorted red-blue-green-yellow in turn.|yes aha|6|
wnola|298|To test how long it takes to see a pattern in unrelated qualifiers.|I think so, the first part is hazy to me though. Every 4th card is correct, following that, rotating to the right each card is correct. I didn't test to left.|yes aha|6|This was really cool!
wonly|308|to see how good the human eye sight is|taking cards from the deck and alligning them in the four key cards|no aha|1|i don't
wnolfs|272|Not really sure, to see if I get distracted by the colours|Just 1 after the other in sequence|yes aha|6|

wnol|304|To figure out which car gets placed onto which pile|eventually!!! You have to place the card on top of the card that has nothing similar to that card. (colour, shape, number of shapes)|yes aha|6|Really enjoyed it.
wnol|283|I honestly was confused because it wasn't a color match or number match.|I just noticed a pattern but I'm not too sure.|no aha|10|No thank you!
wlin|309|Assess peoples instincts on the information they are presented with.|The letter at the bottom of each card corrisponds with the letter on the key cards.|yes aha|5|

wlin|316|to match the letters|matching the letters|yes aha|5|
wlout|324|I assume it was to work out how long it took to identify the pattern for sorting, to ignore the card!|It was the letter underneath the card that equated to the letter underneath the 4 cards|yes aha|4|
wlout|310|To see how quickly people can learn patterns|Yes, the correct stack is the one that doesnt match any properties of the card that I needed to sort, either shape, number or colour|yes aha|6|Fun game, thanks
wnolfs|314|How quickly you can spot the pattern|I think I did eventually work out that the correct sorting was to add the next card to the adjacent stack|yes aha|6|
wlin|323|to see how fast it would take someone to find the solution to the task.|Yes, you had to match the bottom card with a top card that didnt have any of its characteristics. For example the color, shape and the number of shapes in the card could not be same as any other.|yes aha|3|n/a
moonsq|313|To see if I thought there was a 'winning' pattern that was correct, and how I reacted to any patterns of correct answers.|Towards the end it was correct to follow a pattern of selecting each of the colours in a set order, but I didn't find any rule for the majority of the test.|no aha|8|
wnola|312|Test how quick subject was able to find a pattern|The cards had to be laid in order from left to right, but had to find out what the first card to be correct on the left hand pile was first|no aha|10|Hated it.
moonsq|320|something about positive feedback and methods?|nope! Very frustrating!|no aha|7|
wlout|317|to see if you could find the rule|I thought I did a couple of only for it to fail|yes aha|8|
wnolfs|321|to see how long it took to find the pattern|the next card is placed on the next card along|yes aha|6|
wlin|337|To see whether we favour words, colours or objects when sorting quickly?|Yes - it was sorted by letter|yes aha|1|
moonsq|327|To try and ascertain an order for the cards|Blue, green, red and then yellow although i think sometimes, the yellow wasn't included. The majority started blue then green.|no aha|6|
||To see whether people find some sort of pattern to matching the cards|I tried to, but did not really find any...I feel like I operated on memory alone because I did notice that matches sometimes repeat. Still, I did not remember or memorize all matches|no aha|7|
wnola|333|no idea|none|no aha|7|
wlout|338|no idea|no|no aha|10|
wnol|339|if someone would be able to pick up what the pattern/strategy of the game was.|i think so, you had to sort the cards with different coloured cards and with different shapes/number of shapes, where the shapes go to the spaces or at least one of the shapes go to the spaces.|yes aha|7|no

wonly|350|No clue|They corresponded with the letters on the deck|yes aha|1|
wlout|359|To check logical reasoning|Match the letter below and not the colours, shape or pattern.|yes aha|2|
moonsq|348|To measure how quickly I determined the rule for sorting the cards.|At first, I thought it was random. But towards the end, I noticed that the order was simply left-to-right repeated.|yes aha|6|
wlin|358|see how you think the cards should be orted|yes match the letters|no aha|4|
wlout|345|To figure ou tthe answer to how to sort the cards|I id- the letter of the stack was under the card to be matched. It took me several tries to notice this.|yes aha|6|It really took me a minute to figure that out!
wlin|344|Not sure - distraction?|Yes- ignore the shapes and colours. Match up the letters|yes aha|6|
wonly|357|No idea|With no guidance on any rules I just place the letter on top of the same letter card.|no aha|1|
wlin|351|to esure we followed a specific rule, ignoring instincts to match by number or colours|I had to correlate the munbers on the cards|yes aha|1|I enjoyed your experiment!
wnolfs|349|I think the goal was to see if we could figure out what the pattern was based on our thought process. So the experiment was determining what our thought process is like when trying to decipher a puzzle with no instructions really.|I found the rule at the very end: You just put 1 card at a time in each stack, distributing the cards evenly amongst each key card stack. This took me a long time, because at first, I was focused on what was actually on the cards, but I found out that what's on the cards doesn't matter.|yes aha|8|No
wnol|367|To see how long it would take to find the pattern to the problems.|To sort the card onto the pile where there were similarities.|yes aha|2|
wlout|366|sort the given card to the key cards.|sort the given card into a key card that did not match it through colour, number of items, or shape.|yes aha|5|
wlin|365|Drag the cards from the deck one-by-one and drop them onto one of the key cards.|I saw a deck of cards at the bottom of the screen and four key cards at the top of the screen. Then drag the cards from the deck one-by-one and drop them onto one of the key cards.|yes aha|1|I feel comfortable.
wnolfs|356|Identify the rule and the impact of colour perception|I think it may have been to do with preceeding cards shape|yes aha|9|No
wonly|364|To find the sorting rule.|No.|yes aha|8|
wnol|346|I have no idea.|I did not find a rule.|no aha|9|I honestly thought the game was broken and was never going to end. There were numerous times that I considered quitting and returning  the study or trying to contact you about it.
wnola|361|To  see patterns in the cards to work out what deck the card belongs to.|It seemed as if the rules kept changing, it see,Ed to wok by sequence (1,2) and sometime shy the colour.|no aha|7|None
wlout|352|deductive reasoning of how to make it correct|It had to be matching in letters, nothing else.|yes aha|3|
moonsq|369|To see how many people will see a rule for sorting the cards.|It just moved always 1 card to right.|no aha|3|
wnolfs|363|I think it was about color collaborating and define the differences between colors|At a first moment I thought I'm the one who is facing such a problem. I even make a complain about the instruction but after making several mistakes I've found the solution. Rule; You can not match the color, not with dots, even not with the symbol, then the last option you need to pick up.|yes aha|9|It was totally an unexpected study really! it felt like I was shooting towards the sky but later I've the secret solution. Thanks for this odd study!
wlin|372|See how quickly someone solves what is the way to sort the cards|alphabet|yes aha|1|
wlin|379|TO sort the cards|Put all the As together, all the Bs together etc.|yes aha|2|

moonsq|383|I have no idea.|No.|no aha|7|
wonly|385|Learn how to sort the cards|Mine were coded A, B, C &amp; D, so incredibly easy to sort into piles of the same letter.|yes aha|1|This was so easy, I'm not convinced it displayed correctly?  Should the cards have been coloured?
wnol|388|To see how many attempts at figuring out what the sorting mechanism was it took, and then maybe how fast you could sort them once you figured it out|The rule for sorting the cards was that they couldn't share any qualities with the base category pile (color, shape, number of symbols)|yes aha|3|
wnolfs|384|The goal was to add card in the deck which didn't match|To add the card which didn't match in colour, shape, amount|yes aha|3|
wnol|381|learn how quickly a human can figure out the rule of sorting and compare to an algorithm/AI|Sort the card with the pile that is NOT the same colour, NOT the same shape and NOT the same layout|yes aha|6|I was going crazy till I figured it out - and then I couldn't believe I was so stupid!
wlout|380|Make the viewer weigh and give joy when he discovers the pattern|I had to place the card in a place where it has no relation to color, quantity or shape|yes aha|4|.
wnola|382|to see what ways of working out sequences people take, abstract or concrete etc.|left to right and back so 1st card then 2nd card then 3rd then 4th|yes aha|7|
wlout|387|to try and confuse me with the letter and the number of symbols on the card|not really|yes aha|8|
wnolfs|391|To see if I was able to determine the pattern|Eventually, I discovered it just went in the order of 2,3,4,1 and seemed to disregard what was on the card.|yes aha|8|
wnolfs|370|Ability to pick up patterns|Nope!|no aha|9|Nope... hope I don't skew your results being so terrible!
wnolfs|377|To see how people worked out a pattern.|Count the number of shapes on the card. Go 1 card to the right of the card with the same number of shapes, looping to the first one if it's the last one. If the shapes or colours match, go 1 card to the right, and repeat until neither shapes nor colours match. Then you have your correct pair.|yes aha|7|
wnola|375|I have genuinely no idea...I simply could not work out a pattern|No, every time I thought I did it was wrong!|no aha|10|I would love to know the answer
moonsq|390|I have no idea, I found it hard to figure out what I was doing to be honest|it seemed to work in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 but I really didn't know|no aha|10|Did as best I could but was very unsure how to work out the sorting rule
wnola|389|To figure out the pattern for the order of placing the cards.|No, I have no idea what was supposed to be the correct way to do it.|no aha|10|That was a frustrating experience.

wnolfs|412|try and find a patten when sorting out the cards|yeah red green yellow blue|yes aha|3|
wnol|409|To try and determin how the cards match|Yes, the colour, shape and position of the shapes cant match the other card|yes aha|4|
wonly|413|Absolutely no idea.  Would love to know though.|Putting the same cards on each other.|no aha|1|
wlout|415|To see if we could figure out the pattern|The card can't match the color, shape or number of the card it goes on|yes aha|3|I thought this was interesting
wlin|414|Not sure|I thought it was hard to understand but once I figured it out then its straight forward, the letter is on the card at the bottom so you put that on the card at the top.|no aha|3|
wonly|420|to see how quickly we could react|sorting by lettr|no aha|1|
moonsq|418|intuition?|In sequence 4-3-2-1 then start at 4|yes aha|10|I misunderstood, I was moving the coloured cards over the card at the bottom.

wnol|416|I don't really know :-)|Yes, sorting is connected with finding the highest amount of differences between the cards.|yes aha|1|No.
wnola|424|I have no idea, I assumed it would be some kind of test of what strategy people use to sort the cards.|No, it seemed to change all the time.|yes aha|7|
wonly|427|To match the card correctly|Match the letter on the card to the same card letter in the deck|yes aha|1|
wnolfs|433|To see how many turns it took to find out the rule.|You put the card on top of whatever did NOT match color/number/or shape.|yes aha|2|It took me a few turns extra to figure it out because I wasn't sure if I was dragging/dropping correctly.

wlin|442|The goal was to sort the cards.|I just sorted by the letter of the card, not the color or the shapes.|no aha|3|None
wlin|449|See if we can figure out what you were looking for us to sort.|I first tried to sort by the number of items in the card which didn't work. Then I tried to sort by shape, but that didn't work either. Then I tried to sort the number of shapes on the card which also didn't work. I finally sorted by the letter at the bottom and that worked. I had initially thought to do it by the letter but as your instructions stated that I cannot be color blind I thought the sorting had to do with colors, which clearly was not the case.|yes aha|5|How did I compare against other respondents? I am just curious how much slower or faster I was than others.
wnolfs|440|To understand the reasoning of people that have some vision problems.|All I had to do is drag the number 2 on 1, the number 3 on 2, and so on|yes aha|5|
moonsq|446|no|Eventually left to right|yes aha|5|no
wnol|444|Rule learning?|Maybe! I seemed to get it right when I looked for next unique pile - e.g. if it was one blue square, I looked for the blue pile, and sorted it to the to the right of that as long as it had a different number and shape to that pile. If it didn't, I looked at the next, and so on.|yes aha|7|

I tried colours, shapes and numbers before letters. Robin Dunbar's Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language springs to mind!
wonly|476|To work out the way to sort the deck of cards to the key cards.|You must match the letter on the card from the deck to the key card above.|yes aha|1|I feel like the goal of the experiment is not as it seems. It was too easy. But I'm baffled as to what the true objective of the experiment is.
wnolfs|475|the goal was to arrange each card into the correct space. it is essentially finding the patterns.|yes I found the rule it was to arrange each card into the only spot that does not match either its colour, shape or amount. only one card would not match the pattern in any of those ways.|yes aha|4|this was a interesting experiment. I was having some troubles finding the solution quickly but once you find it, you really see it.
wlin|477|See whether or not a participant can figure the correct method to match cards.|Match by the letters|yes aha|3|No
wonly|483|to see if I could follow directions|match the letter on the card|no aha|1|
wlin|484|I'm not sure|I just went by number|no aha|1|Great survey!
moonsq|481|UNSURE|NO|no aha|10|
wnola|480|To test if you could find the rule for sorting and see which rules people found first|1st card to 1st,2nd to 2nd, 3rd to 3rd,4th to 4th, 5th to 1st and so on|yes aha|6|
wlout|485|I think it was problem solving(?). I think you wanted to see how many tries it took to figure out the correct way to sort the cards.|A-A, B-B etc.|yes aha|8|It was fun! Thanks :)
wnola|487|To discover how to sort the cards|the rule was following the sequence 1,2,3,4 and placing the card one after another in order|yes aha|7|
wlout|478|To see how long it took us out to figure out the correct criteria for matching the cards which would be determined through a process of elimination finding out the relationship between the correctly nd incorrectly matched cards- which variables were at play|It was a case of matching the card to another that was not alike in any of the 3 categories: shape, the quantity of shapes and the colour of shapes. The most dissimilar card.|yes aha|5|I'm beyond embarrassed it took me so long as I massively over-complicated it in my head thinking there was math involved and all sorts... I feel really, really stupid that it took me so long to figure when I'm usually good at non verbal reasoning etc.
wnolfs|489|To find a pattern|place the cards in order from left to right|yes aha|6|
wlin|491|to match the cards by letter, rather than colour or shape||yes aha|1|
wnol|493|I feel the goal is to understand how people sort cards|I didn't, unfortunately|no aha|10|
wlin|498|Checking to see if the writing on the card was the decisive factor or the contents of it.|I just quickly checked the letter|no aha|1|NA
wnolfs|496|To see how long it takes for the participant to figure out the trend and adapt.|Sorting by the odd one out.|yes aha|6|
moonsq|495|To test memory|I think so, it was basically in order from left to right towards the end|yes aha|5|
wlout|499|To see what information we look at first|The letter underneath the cards and nothing on the actual card itself relating to colour, shape or number of symbols.|yes aha|4|Took me way too long to figure out. It's interesting how stuck in a way of thinking one can become. Needed to find a different way of seeing.
wnolfs|503|To try and find the pattern in which the cards were required to be sorted.|It took me a while but yes. The rule I beleive was that the once the first card was matched to the first deal, it then went second, then third deal and fourth and repeat. It did not matter the colour shape or pattern, always first deal, then second, 3rd deal and fourth and then repeat back to first.|yes aha|7|Very fun :). Felt like a hamster in a cage with a ball, but a fun experience.
moonsq|502|i'm sorry about that i couldn't find the main goal of this experiment.|yes. it was all bout the algorithm of correct order of shape.|no aha|1|thanks for the study it was fun for me.
wnol|500|To find out how long it takes people to find the correct rule.|Place the card where there are no similaries in: colour, shape and number|yes aha|6|Thank you for this experiment. Good luck with your research!
wonly|504|To see if people who do these studies actually have any common sence and if they read the instructions prior to starting the study.|yes it was alphabetical order|yes aha|2|only dificulty was getting a mouse to work. havent used one for years ... dug it out of the draw just in case it was a speed game.
wlin|505|To determine methods of categorising items|Sorted by letter|yes aha|2|It was fun, thank you
wlout|506|To determine how people first sort cards using their instinct (in this scenario, between the colors, the number of shapes, or the letter below)|Sort the card based on the letter below the card.|yes aha|1|
||To find a pattern|No|no aha|8|
wlout|508|see how quick participants could find how to match|it was the letter beneath the card|yes aha|4|
wonly|513|I assume the aim was to see how people match patterns but that i was put into the control group|Cards at the top said A, B, C or D. Card on my pile had one of those letters on. I matched A with A, B with B, C with C and D with D.|yes aha|1|
wnola|517|See how long it takes respondents to figure out there is a pattern and no actual connection between the cards|you just sort them in order|yes aha|5|
wnola|510|To see how long it took to find out the sorting pattern|Yes. You place the first card in the pile to the left and add every card to the next pile to the right until going back to the first pile|yes aha|6|
wlin|507|To test how quickly different people are able to determine the rule for sorting cards despite there being many similarities between the cards and lack of in-depth instructions.|Yes. The cards were sorted based on their respective letters.|yes aha|2|N/A
wnolfs|512|I'm not too sure to be quite honest, maybe it was to test my ability to follow instructions, as well as my ability to find the solution to a problem within a set amount of time.|Yes, the cards were supposed to be sorted in chronological order. Each new card had to be placed in the deck right next to it.|yes aha|3|
wnol|516|To see how quickly individuals can solve something|They can't be the same shape, colour or number of shapes.|yes aha|7|I thought I had it worked out a couple of times but slowly I had enough errors to piece together enough information to correctly guess each time.
wnolfs|519|social study|no|no aha|5|excellent study
wnol|509|attention check|yes i found a rule,the rule was i have not return to this site,do not have press the refresh or back button of my browser.|yes aha|8|no
wonly|520|well my first thoughts was to email the researcher and tell them there was a glitch, because the first page made no sense to me, with every card being white, then i realised that was the point, finally i think it was about who could do it the fastest in  the the most accuate way.|there was no card colours or shapes on the cards. only letters. so i simply puy each card to the corresponding letter above.|yes aha|2|i was under the impression that you would be using colour and different shapes so im confused how colour blindness would affect a black and white study?
wlout|522|To see how quickly participants would spot the pattern|The card cannot match the shape, colour or count of symbols on the stack you put it on.|yes aha|2|
moonsq|525|How long it takes individuals to spot a pattern|Yes, the cards were sorted from left to right.|yes aha|5|
wnola|524|To find the rule|I didn't to be honest. Tried sorting by clors, then shapes, yet it didn't match most of the times|yes aha|7|What was the rule?
wnolfs|526|To see if you can figure out the strategy.|I ended up just putting each card as it was shown starting from the left side to the right side.|yes aha|8|
