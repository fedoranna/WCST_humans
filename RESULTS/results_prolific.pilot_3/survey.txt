wlin|2|Look at how people problem solve|The letters matched|yes aha|5|
wlin|3|Perhaps to be able to see the process of trying to figure out a rule.|It took me a while! I had seemingly ignored the letter for ages and tried all kinds of things with number, shape, colour etc. The rule is simply matching the letter.|yes aha|3|
wlin|6|To identify how long it takes to figure out the rule.|Yes, the letter on the bottom deck corresponds with the letters in the key cards.|yes aha|5|
wlin|5|See how face someone can work out a pattern through their errors|Yes! It had to not relate to one of the 4 cards. Eg one blue star could not go with the stars card, the blue card or the card with 1 shape.|yes aha|8|
wlin|9|i have no idea|letters matched|yes aha|8|weirdest test ive done so far
wlin|12|i have no idea|yes it is according to the letter|yes aha|1|
wlin|11|Seeing if the brain could differentiate between the different ways to sort something- shape, number, letter on them|Yes- sort them using the letter, ABCD|yes aha|3|
wlin|7|A reaction test|The rule was you had to link the letter with the other letter|no aha|1|No, It was a good survey to do. i hope i was help with this survey
wlin|8|To sort the cards correctly|Eventually yes, and believe me I felt dumb once I realised what it was. I was so focus on it being something to do with the patten, number of items or colour that I didn't notice the letter at the bottom of the card. Eventually I noticed the letters and realised I needed to sort by letter.|yes aha|2|That was really interesting, and now I'm wondering if the letters were there all the time or whether they appeared half way through the experiment. Hope the study goes well :)
wlin|10|test how quickly people react to the cards|if the letter of the bottom card is B, for example, match with B on the top and so on...|yes aha|2|no, thanks
